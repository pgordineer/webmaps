Traditional water sourcing and storage methods, primarily the process of trucking water across public and private roadways, im- pose heavy burdens on public infrastructure. This heavy trucking not only exacerbates traffic congestion, causes visual and auditory disturbances for local communities, and damages road net- works servicing these gas operations, but in doing so also imposes financial strains on often under- funded public entities and increases net carbon emissions linked to energy production. Freshwater impoundments represent a sustainable water management solution, enabling large-scale pumped water storage and captured rainwater for hydraulic fracturing. This study employs a geographic information system (GIS)-based approach to investigate the capacity of existing freshwater im- poundments on public lands within the Marcellus Shale region. It assesses their potential to meet the ongoing water demands of continued hydraulic fracturing by analyzing active impoundment footprints, storage capacities, and annual precipitation capture rates. This research further ex- amines impoundment withdrawals for wells completed in the Marcellus Shale, calculating water demand per well of a given production length and the water use per unit of gas delivered to mar- ket. The findings emphasize that the carbon footprint is not the sole environmental impact of shale gas usage; water management also plays a critical role. By demonstrating the potential of fresh- water impoundments to support efficient and sustainable water practices and reduce infrastructure burdens, this study contributes valuable insights for strategic infrastructure planning. It aims to mitigate environmental impacts and enhance water security for hydraulic fracturing operations and the surrounding communities and ecosystems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Keywords<span class="p">: infrastructure planning, marcellus shale, water management, spatial analysis, public lands, freshwater impoundments, sustainability</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1">INTRODUCTION</a></h1><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Marcellus Shale, a vast underground rock formation spanning parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and other nearby states, holds significant natural gas reserves. The extraction of this hydrocarbon resource through the process of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) has revolution- ized the energy landscape, contributing to significant growth in regional energy production and economic growth. However, this boom in hydrocarbon production comes alongside significant environmental challenges, particularly concerning water usage and its impact on surrounding in- frastructure and ecosystems.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 52pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="500" height="247" alt="image" src="Gordineer_MastersRep_052024_files/Image_001.jpg"/></span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">FIGURE 1<span class="p">: Marcellus Shale Boundary and Gas Play from U.S. Energy Information Administra- tion.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 101pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="369" height="269" alt="image" src="Gordineer_MastersRep_052024_files/Image_002.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h1 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 118pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">FIGURE 2<span class="p">: Marcellus wells within Pennsylvania.</span></h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: left;"><a href="#bookmark36" class="a">Hydraulic fracturing requires substantial amounts of water, typically millions of gallons per well, for the process of fracturing the shale rock and releasing the trapped natural gas </a><a href="#bookmark36">(Duthu and</a></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a href="#bookmark36" class="a">Bradley (</a>1<a href="#bookmark37" class="a">), Jiang et al.

Traditionally, this water is sourced from surface waters, such as rivers and streams, and transported to well sites via truck, leading to heavy burdens on public infrastructure. This trucking of water not only contributes to traffic congestion, road damage, and increased maintenance costs, but also generates air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, impacting both local communities and the global environment (Kille (</a>5<a href="#bookmark41" class="a">), Tsapakis (</a>6<a href="#bookmark36" class="a">)). The search for sustainable water management solutions has increased interest in freshwater impoundments. These impoundments, constructed on or near well pads, can store large volumes of pumped water and captured rainwater, providing a readily available water source for hydraulic fracturing operations (Duthu and Bradley (</a>1<span class="p">)). By utilizing impoundments, the in- dustry can reduce its reliance on traditional water transport methods and minimize the negative impacts of water trucking, including road damage, traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. This study investigates the potential of freshwater impoundments on public lands within the Marcellus Shale region to meet the water demands of hydraulic fracturing operations. Employing a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based approach, this study analyzes active im- poundments’ existing footprint, storage capacities, and annual precipitation capture rates to assess their potential contribution to sustainable water management. Furthermore, this research examines impoundment withdrawals for hydraulically fractured wells, calculating the water demand per well based on factors related to its planned development, as well as calculating the water use per unit of gas delivered to market. This research aims to demonstrate that the environmental factors of shale gas extract extend beyond the carbon emissions directly associated with its use; water management plays a critical role. By highlighting the potential of freshwater impoundments to support efficient and sustainable water practices, this study contributes valuable insights for strategic infrastructure planning and decision-making. Ultimately, this study aims to promote solutions that mitigate the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and enhance water security for the industry and the surrounding communities and ecosystems.</span></p><h1 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark2">LITERATURE REVIEW</a></h1><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The water demands of Marcellus Shale gas extraction via hydraulic fracturing pose significant challenges to infrastructure and environmental sustainability.

This high water demand has raised concerns about the sustainability of water withdrawals, par- ticularly in areas with limited water resources or competing demands. Research has shown that surface water sources, such as rivers and streams, are predominantly used for fracking, raising potential ecological concerns related to dewatering and impacts on aquatic life (Hansen et al.

The calculated cost per truck per trip is $64.8. The calculated cost per gallon transported is $.01296. The calculated average cost per well in terms of public infrastructure damage due to trucking if freshwater impoundments are not utilized is $52,000. The estimated water use per unit of energy delivered to market is calculated to be approximately 1 gallon per Mcf of natural gas. The combined capacity of the 30 freshwater storage impoundments is 87.2 Mgal. While future studies should focus on freshwater impoundment usage rates, if each impoundment’s capacity was utilized just once in its lifetime, the total potential infrastructure cost reduction would be approximately</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">$1.1 million.

When considered alongside the estimated water</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">usage per well and acre of wellbore drainage area and the infrastructure costs associated with al- ternatives, this capacity suggests that strategically placed and well-managed impoundments could significantly contribute to meeting the water needs of hydraulic fracturing operations while reduc- ing overall impact.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Further investigation into freshwater impoundments would provide a more precise under- standing of their ability to meet the dynamic water demands of the industry consistently. Future works could focus on developing suitability models for strategic and precise placement of fresh- water impoundments. Additional work could be completed to compile current water transport pipelines to determine the service area of existing or potential freshwater impoundments. Further studies may explore the long-term sustainability of these impoundments, as well as evaporation rates, sedimentation, and liner leakage rates. Future efforts should also focus towards public en- gagement; prior works have studied public response to trucking traffic, but not public opinion of freshwater impoundment infrastructure on public lands.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark30">CONCLUSIONS</a></h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This study has shed light on the significant potential of freshwater impoundments as a sustainable water management solution for hydraulic fracturing operations within the Marcellus Shale region.

The findings of this study highlight several key conclusions.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark31">Impoundments offer substantial storage capacity</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The combined storage capacity of the 22 analyzed impoundments demonstrates their potential to significantly contribute to meeting the water demands of hydraulic fracturing, reducing reliance on alternative water management methods, and minimizing the associated environmental impacts.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">-Rainfall capture presents a sustainable water source: The analysis of annual rainfall capture poten- tial emphasizes the ability of impoundments to harness precipitation as a sustainable water source, reducing reliance on water withdrawals from surface and groundwater sources and minimizing associated ecological disruptions.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark32">Infrastructure cost reduction is significant</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Utilizing impoundments instead of trucking water leads to substantial reductions in truck traffic, resulting in considerable cost savings associated with road maintenance and repairs. This alleviates the financial burden on public entities responsible for infrastructure upkeep and contributes to a more economically sustainable approach to shale gas development.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark33">Environmental benefits are multifaceted</a></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">By minimizing truck traffic, impoundments contribute to a smaller environmental footprint by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and noise pollution. Additionally, capturing and utilizing accumulated precipitation through impoundments promotes water conservation and protects sensitive aquatic ecosystems.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">This study underscores the importance of strategic planning and GIS analysis in optimizing the placement and utilization of freshwater impoundments. By considering factors such as prox- imity to well sites, accessibility, and environmental impacts, we can ensure that impoundments are developed and managed to maximize their benefits while minimizing potential risks.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">While the carbon footprint of natural gas usage is often the focus of environmental concerns related to shale gas development, this study emphasizes the critical role of water management. Freshwater impoundments offer a practical and effective solution for reducing the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing and enhancing water security for the industry and the surrounding communities.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;text-align: justify;">Moving forward, continued research and collaboration among stakeholders are crucial steps towards promoting the adoption of sustainable water management practices and ensuring respon- sible continued development of the Marcellus Shale resource. By embracing solutions such as freshwater impoundments, we can strive towards a future where the benefits of shale gas are bal- anced with the protection of our environment and water resources for generations to come.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark34">DECLARATION OF CONFLICTING INTERESTS</a></h1><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">At the time of writing the author held a position as an employee of a public agency responsible for managing oil and gas leasing of public lands within the Marcellus Shale region.
